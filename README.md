# Matlabette
Matlabette is a minimal [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop) clone of MATLAB.

It's also my project for Andela Class VI boot camp.

## Features
 * Array creation
 
 * Array and matrix operations
 
 * Array concatenation
 
 * Saving and loading workspace:
 
    The command `save > filename.mat` saves variables in the workspace.
    
    The command `load filename.mat` loads the variables in `filename.mat` into the workspace.
